# TheGoLangProject

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.

There are two major implementations:

Google's self-hosting "gc" compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, and WebAssembly.
gofrontend, a frontend to other compilers, with the libgo library. 
With GCC the combination is gccgo ,with LLVM the combination is gollvm.

A third-party source-to-source compiler, GopherJS compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.


Advantages:  

Flexible- It is concise, simple and easy to read.
Concurrency- It allows multiple process running simultaneously and effectively.
Quick Outcome- Its compilation time is very fast.
Library- It provides a rich standard library.
Garbage collection- It is a key feature of go. Go excels in giving a lot of control over memory allocation and has dramatically reduced latency in the most recent versions of the garbage collector.
It validates for the interface and type embedding.

Disadvantages:  

It has no support for generics, even if there are many discussions about it.
The packages distributed with this programming language is quite useful but Go is not so object-oriented in the conventional sense.
There is absence of some libraries especially a UI tool kit.

Some popular Applications developed in Go Language

Docker: a set of tools for deploying linux containers
Openshift: a cloud computing platform as a service by Red Hat.
Kubernetes: The future of seamlessly automated deployment processes
Dropbox: migrated some of their critical components from Python to Go.
Netflix: for two part of their server architecture.
InfluxDB: is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData.
Golang: The language itself was written in Go.
