# Go
Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.
